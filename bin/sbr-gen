This is a skeleton file that can serve as a starting point for a Python
console script. To run this script uncomment the following lines in the
``[options.entry_points]`` section in ``setup.cfg``::
    console_scripts =
         fibonacci = copyrightheader.skeleton:run
Then run ``pip install .`` (or ``pip install -e .`` for editable mode)
which will install the command ``fibonacci`` inside your current environment.
Besides console scripts, the header (i.e. until ``_logger``...) of this file can
also be used as template for Python modules.
Note:
    This skeleton file can be safely removed if not needed!
